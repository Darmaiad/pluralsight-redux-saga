# Redux Saga (Pluralsight)
A (very) functional shopping cart. The project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Redux Saga](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/redux-saga/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Installation
* Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. 
* Navigate to the folder that you/was created. 
* Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. 
* You can execute the application in the following modes: 
  * Run `npm run dev` to launch to the project in development environment.
  * Run `npm run prod` to launch to the project in production environment.
  * Run `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Description
This is a shopping cart project, rich in functionality, in order to showcase the power of Redux Saga. I developed the project in my own devepment environment, while coding along with the courses' instructor. 

The instructor included a ready-made separate project, which constituted the back-end. After I integrated that project with my own and refactored the server to fit my preferred practices, I created two separate servers, one for Development and one for Production.

As always, there are are minor refactors and comments in the code.
