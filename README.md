# Redux Saga (Pluralsight)
A (very) functional shopping cart. The project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Redux Saga](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/redux-saga/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Description
This is a shopping cart project, rich in functionality, showcaing the power of Redux Saga. I developed the project in my own devepment environment, while coding along with the course's instructor. 

The instructor included a ready-made separate project, which constituted the back-end. I merged and integrated that project with my own. After that, I rewrote the server to fit my preferences. 

This project provides the option of running it with one of two servers: one for Development or one for Production.

As always, there is refactoring (to suit my tastes) and comments in the code.
